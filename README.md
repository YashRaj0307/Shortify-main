   ```

2. Set up environment variables:
   Create an `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following:
   ```
   DB_URL=jdbc:postgresql://<NEON_DB_URL>
   DB_USERNAME=<YOUR_DB_USERNAME>
   DB_PASSWORD=<YOUR_DB_PASSWORD>
   JWT_SECRET=<YOUR_JWT_SECRET>
   ```

3. Build and run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker build -t fullstack-backend .
   docker run -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env fullstack-backend
   ```

4. Test the API:
   Visit `http://localhost:8080/api/` in your browser or API testing tool (e.g., Postman).
